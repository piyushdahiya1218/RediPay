# RediPay

This project consisting of 2 apps, Vendor and Customer, aims to provide business to vendors by directly connecting them to customers, and convenience to customers who wants to buy fruits or vegetables from their local street vendor at the comfort of their home.

Vendor app has Aadhar authentication after which they can create their cart of fruits and vegetables along with the quantity and price at which they want to sell. Their cart information along with their current live location is put on a map which can be seen by the customers.

Customers on their app can see the live location of vendors on the map along with the cart information. Customers can select fruits and vegetables available in vendor's cart and can then send an order request to vendor, which when accepted by the vendor, exposes the live location of customer as well to help the vendor navigate.
